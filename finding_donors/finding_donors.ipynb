    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Real-world example:\n",
    "Person recognition - verifying the identity of an unique individual using charesteristics of that person such as \n",
    "facial, finger-print, behavior (speech and handwriting). This involves multiple domains of features where ensemble learning can work on each feature set individually and merge into single classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- accurate algorithm\n",
    "- runs effeciently on large data sets\n",
    "- solves complicated classification problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- overfits with noisy datasets (many outliers)\n",
    "- sometimes runtime can be large\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is very good candidate for this dataset for similar reasons as using DecisionTree model. However, RandomForest builds various decision trees with subsets of the data and then averages the classification output. This is less chance of overfitting as each individual decision tree works with an isolated data subset. \n",

    "systems - recommending similar items to what a user liked by comparing the set of users who like each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- simple to implement\n",

    "- handles multi-class cases\n",

    "- expensive query time (large search problem to find nearest neighbor)\n",
    "- requires storage of data\n",
    "- must have meaningful distance function\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to a classification output that recommends whether a person will donate or not - KNN might be a good candidate. Intuitively, I don't think it will be a good candidate as KNN persists the data and is flexible for new dataset to train with - which is not the case in this scenario. However, it would be good to have a classifier to compare relative results against. \n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",

    "Out the 3 models, KNeighbors consistently has the poorest performance and accuracy. This could be due to the model not being suitable for this data set. Thus, lets evaluate between RandomForest and DecisionTree since their performances are much closer to each other. \n",

    "* Pred/training time\n",

    "    \n",

    "    \n",

    "    * RandomForest: Accuracy of 0.840 and f-measure score of 0.835\n",

    "RandomForest is a divide and conquer method used to improve performance of decision tree based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees is a software model similar asking \"20 questions\" game. The model evaluates all important points and asks revelant questions to get to an answer eventually. This might be like, \"Is the person above 21 years of age?\" and build 2 paths where the person is above 21 years and below 21 years. Such questions are built based on all the \"features\" in a data set such as age, hours-per-week, martial-status, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest divides up the total data set into multiple configurable subsets and feeds these subsets into sets of decision trees. The decision tree then evaluates and builds the tree with different questions only based on the subset of data it was provided with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree learns off the data subset and produces a result of whether a person earns more than 50K and is eligable for donation. The result of each model is merged via a technique called \"bagging\" - where the result maybe merged by taking the average of all results produced.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "If training time was a factor, it would be good to consider using the reduced data as training set however that comes with the cost of reduced accuracy and F-score. It seems as though there is a trade-off between accuracy and runtime of training/testing the model. This is due to to the fact that many of the features not considered in the reduced data help add up small increments of positive results that increase the accuracy and F-score. "
